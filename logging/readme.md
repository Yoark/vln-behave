This folder provides utils and guidelines needed for logging model results such that we can perform analysis on them later. We also provide hamt example to show how to logging works. We separate the modification needed into different files.

For the HAMT example, main modifications are in the following files:

`hamt_example/finetune_src/r2r/agent_cmt.py`
`hamt_example/finetune_src/r2r/parser.py`
